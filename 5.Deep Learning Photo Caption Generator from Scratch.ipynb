    "# Deep Learning Photo Caption Generator from Scratch \n",
    "\n",
    "Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on examples of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on caption generation problems. What is most impressive about these methods is a single end-to-end model can be defined to predict a caption, given a photo, instead of requiring sophisticated data preparation or a pipeline of specifically designed models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will discover how to develop a photo captioning deep learning model from scratch.\n",

    "A good dataset to use when getting started with image captioning is the Flickr8K dataset.\n",

    "The reason is because it is realistic and relatively small so that you can download it and build models on your workstation using a CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitive description of the dataset is in the paper [“Framing Image Description as a Ranking Task: Data, Models and Evaluation Metrics” from 2013.](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair)\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors describe the dataset as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    We introduce a new benchmark collection for sentence-based image description and search, consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "    …\n",
    "\n",
    "*    The images were chosen from six different Flickr groups, and tend not to contain any well-known people or locations, but were manually selected to depict a variety of scenes and situations.\n",

    "— Framing Image Description as a Ranking Task: Data, Models and Evaluation Metrics, 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is available for free. You must complete a request form and the links to the dataset will be emailed to you. I would love to link to them for you, but the email address expressly requests: “Please do not redistribute the dataset“.\n",

    "    Flickr8k_text.zip (2.2 Megabytes) An archive of all text descriptions for photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the datasets and unzip them into your current working directory. You will have two directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flicker8k_Dataset: Contains 8092 photographs in JPEG format.\n",
    "    Flickr8k_text: Contains a number of files containing different sources of descriptions for the photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has a pre-defined training dataset (6,000 images), development dataset (1,000 images), and test dataset (1,000 images).\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure that can be used to evaluate the skill of the model are BLEU scores. For reference, below are some ball-park BLEU scores for skillful models when evaluated on the test dataset (taken from the 2017 paper [“Where to put the Image in an Image Caption Generator“):]('https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09137')\n",
    "\n",
    "*    BLEU-1: 0.401 to 0.578.\n",

    "\n",
    "We describe the BLEU metric more later when we work on evaluating our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s look at how to load the images.\n",
    "## Prepare Photo Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a pre-trained model to interpret the content of the photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many models to choose from. In this case, we will use the Oxford Visual Geometry Group, or VGG, model that won the ImageNet competition in 2014. Learn more about the model here:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Visual Recognition]('http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/')\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides this pre-trained model directly. Note, the first time you use this model, Keras will download the model weights from the Internet, which are about 500 Megabytes. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use this model as part of a broader image caption model. The problem is, it is a large model and running each photo through the network every time we want to test a new language model configuration (downstream) is redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can pre-compute the “photo features” using the pre-trained model and save them to file. We can then load these features later and feed them into our model as the interpretation of a given photo in the dataset. It is no different to running the photo through the full VGG model; it is just we will have done it once in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an optimization that will make training our models faster and consume less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can load the VGG model in Keras using the VGG class. We will remove the last layer from the loaded model, as this is the model used to predict a classification for a photo. We are not interested in classifying images, but we are interested in the internal representation of the photo right before a classification is made. These are the “features” that the model has extracted from the photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras also provides tools for reshaping the loaded photo into the preferred size for the model (e.g. 3 channel 224 x 224 pixel image).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a function named extract_features() that, given a directory name, will load each photo, prepare it for VGG, and collect the predicted features from the VGG model. The image features are a 1-dimensional 4,096 element vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a dictionary of image identifier to image features.\n",
