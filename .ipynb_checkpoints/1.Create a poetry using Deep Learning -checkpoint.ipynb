    "## What are text generators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, there is a huge amount of data that can be categorized as sequential. It is present in the form of audio, video, text, time series, sensor data, etc. A special thing about this type of data is that if two events are occurring in a particular time frame, the occurrence of event A before event B is an entirely different scenario as compared to the occurrence of event A after event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in conventional machine learning problems, it hardly matters whether a particular data point was recorded before the other. This consideration gives our sequence prediction problems a different solving approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text, a stream of characters lined up one after another, is a difficult thing to crack. This is because when handling text, a model may be trained to make very accurate predictions using the sequences that have occurred previously, but one wrong prediction has the potential to make the entire sentence meaningless. However, in case of a numerical sequence prediction problem, even if a prediction goes entirely south, it could still be considered a valid prediction (maybe with a high bias). But, it would not strike the eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes text generators tricky!\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better understanding of the code please go through my previous article, where I have discussed the theory behind LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Different Steps of Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generation usually involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Importing Dependencies\n",
    "    Loading of Data\n",
    "    Creating Character/Word mappings\n",
    "    Data Preprocessing\n",
    "    Modelling\n",
    "    Generating text\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at each one in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Importing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "from keras.layers import Dense\n",
    "from keras.layers import Dropout\n",
    "from keras.layers import LSTM\n",
    "from keras.utils import np_utils\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "This is self-explanatory. We are importing all libraries required for our study.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "text=(open(\"/Users/pranjal/Desktop/text_generator/sonnets.txt\").read())\n",
    "text=text.lower()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we are loading a combined collection of all Shakespearean sonnets that can be downloaded from here. I cleaned up this file to remove the start and end credits, and it can be downloaded from my git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text file is opened and saved in text. This content is then converted into lowercase, to reduce the number of possible words (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Creating character/word mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping is a step in which we assign an arbitrary number to a character/word in the text. In this way, all unique characters/words are mapped to a number. This is important, because machines understand numbers far better than text, and this subsequently makes the training process easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "characters = sorted(list(set(text)))\n",
    "n_to_char = {n:char for n, char in enumerate(characters)}\n",
    "char_to_n = {char:n for n, char in enumerate(characters)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "I have created a dictionary with a number assigned to each unique character present in the text. All unique characters are first stored in characters and are then enumerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must also be noted here that I have used character level mappings and not word mappings. However, when compared with each other, a word-based model shows much higher accuracy as compared to a character-based model. This is because the latter model requires a much larger network to learn long-term dependencies as it not only has to remember the sequences of words, but also has to learn to predict a grammatically correct word. However, in case of a word-based model, the latter has already been taken care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since this is a small dataset (with 17,670 words), and the number of unique words (4,605 in number) constitute around one-fourth of the data, it would not be a wise decision to train on such a mapping. This is because if we assume that all unique words occurred equally in number (which is not true), we would have a word occurring roughly four times in the entire training dataset, which is just not sufficient to build a text generator.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most tricky part when it comes to building LSTM models. Transforming the data at hand into a relatable format is a difficult task.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll break down the process into small parts to make it easier for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "X = []\n",
    " Y = []\n",
    "length = len(text)\n",
    "seq_length = 100\n",
    "  for i in range(0, length-seq_length, 1):\n",
    "     sequence = text[i:i + seq_length]\n",
    "     label =text[i + seq_length]\n",
    "     X.append([char_to_n[char] for char in sequence])\n",
    "     Y.append(char_to_n[label])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, X is our train array, and Y is our target array.\n",
    "\n",
    "seq_length is the length of the sequence of characters that we want to consider before predicting a particular character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop is used to iterate over the entire length of the text and create such sequences (stored in X) and their true values (stored in Y). Now, it’s difficult to visualize the concept of true values here. Let’s understand this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sequence length of 4 and the text “hello india”, we would have our X and Y (not encoded as numbers for ease of understanding) as below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "X \tY\n",
    "[h, e, l, l] \t[o]\n",
    "[e, l, l, o] \t[ ]\n",
    "[l, l, o,  ] \t[i]\n",
    "[l, o,  , i] \t[n]\n",
    "…. \t….\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, LSTMs accept input in the form of (number_of_sequences, length_of_sequence, number_of_features) which is not the current format of the arrays. Also, we need to transform the array Y into a one-hot encoded format.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "X_modified = np.reshape(X, (len(X), seq_length, 1))\n",
    "X_modified = X_modified / float(len(characters))\n",
    "Y_modified = np_utils.to_categorical(Y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We first reshape the array X into our required dimensions. Then, we scale the values of our X_modified so that our neural network can train faster and there is a lesser chance of getting stuck in a local minima. Also, our Y_modified is one-hot encoded to remove any ordinal relationship that may have been introduced in the process of mapping the characters. That is, ‘a’ might be assigned a lower number as compared to ‘z’, but that doesn’t signify any relationship between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final arrays will look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "X_modified \tY_modified\n",
    "[[ 0.44444444],\n",
    "[ 0.33333333],\n",

    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "## Modelling\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "model.add(LSTM(400, input_shape=(X_modified.shape[1], X_modified.shape[2]), return_sequences=True))\n",
    "model.add(Dropout(0.2))\n",
    "model.add(LSTM(400))\n",
    "model.add(Dropout(0.2))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(Y_modified.shape[1], activation='softmax'))\n",
    "model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We are building a sequential model with two LSTM layers having 400 units each. The first layer needs to be fed in with the input shape. In order for the next LSTM layer to be able to process the same sequences, we enter the return_sequences parameter as True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, dropout layers with a 20% dropout have been added to check for over-fitting. The last layer outputs a one hot encoded vector which gives the character output.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Generating Text\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "\n",
    "string_mapped = X[99]\n",
    "# generating characters\n",
    "for i in range(seq_length):\n",
    "    x = np.reshape(string_mapped,(1,len(string_mapped), 1))\n",
    "    x = x / float(len(characters))\n",
    "    pred_index = np.argmax(model.predict(x, verbose=0))\n",
    "    seq = [n_to_char[value] for value in string_mapped]\n",
    "    string_mapped.append(pred_index)\n",
    "    string_mapped = string_mapped[1:len(string_mapped)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "We start off with a random row from the X array, that is an array of 100 characters. After this, we target predicting another 100 characters following X. The input is reshaped and scaled as previously and the next character with maximum probability is predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "seq is used to store the decoded format of the string that has been predicted till now. Next, the new string is updated, such that the first character is removed and the new predicted character is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the entire code on my git repo here. I’ve provided the training file, notebooks and trained model weights for your reference.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Experimenting with different models\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline model, when trained for 1 epoch with a batch size of 100, gave the following output:\n",

    " \n",
    "## A more trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we trained our model for 100 epochs and a batch size of 50. We at least obtained a non-repetitive sequence of characters, which contains a decent number of legitimate words. Also, the model learnt to produce a sonnet-like word structure.\n",
