    "\n",
    "In 2014, researchers from Google released a paper, Show And Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator. At the time, this architecture was state-of-the-art on the MSCOCO dataset. It utilized a CNN + LSTM to take an image as input and output a caption.\n",
    "A CNN-LSTM Image Caption Architecture source\n",
    "Using a CNN for image embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network can be used to create a dense feature vector. This dense vector, also called an embedding, can be used as feature input into other algorithms or networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an image caption model, this embedding becomes a dense representation of the image and will be used as the initial state of the LSTM.\n",
    "Mapping input to embedding source\n",
    "LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "An LSTM is a recurrent neural network architecture that is commonly used in problems with temporal dependences. It succeeds in being able to capture information about previous states to better inform the current prediction through its memory cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LSTM consists of three main components: a forget gate, input gate, and output gate. Each of these gates is responsible for altering updates to the cell’s memory state.\n",
    "An unrolled LSTM source\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper understanding of LSTM’s, visit Chris Olah’s post.\n",
    "Prediction with image as initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sentence language model, an LSTM is predicting the next word in a sentence. Similarly, in a character language model, an LSTM is trying to predict the next character, given the context of previously seen characters.\n",
    "Sentence and character model predictions source\n",
    "\n",
    "In an image caption model, you will create an embedding of the image. This embedding will then be fed as initial state into an LSTM. This becomes the first previous state to the language model, influencing the next predicted words.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time-step, the LSTM considers the previous cell state and outputs a prediction for the most probable next value in the sequence. This process is repeated until the end token is sampled, signaling the end of the caption.\n",
    "Sampling characters from an LSTM. source\n",
    "Captions as a search problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating a caption can be viewed as a graph search problem. Here, the nodes are words. The edges are the probability of moving from one node to another. Finding the optimal path involves maximizing the total probability of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling and choosing the most probable next value is a greedy approach to generating a caption. It is computationally efficient, but can lead to a sub-optimal result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all possible words, it would not be computationally/space efficient to calculate all possible sentences and determine the optimal sentence. This rules out using a search algorithm such as Depth First Search or Breadth First Search to find the optimal path.\n",
    "source\n",
    "Beam Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search is a breadth-first search algorithm that explores the most promising nodes. It generates all possible next paths, keeping only the top N best candidates at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of nodes to expand from is fixed, this algorithm is space-efficient and allows more potential candidates than a best-first search.\n",
    "Beam search for building a sentence. source\n",
    "Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, you’ve learned about creating a model architecture to generate a sentence, given an image. This is done by utilizing a CNN to create a dense embedding and feeding this as initial state to an LSTM. Additionally, you’ve learned how to generate better sentences with beam search.\n",

    "In the next section, you’ll learn to generate captions from a pre-trained model in Tensorflow.\n",
